# Ada Support API Documentation

Our API is available to any of our organizations' users at `{orgname}.ada.support/api/` and expects JSON. The Ada API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. We use built-in HTTP features, like [HTTP authentication](authentication.md) and HTTP verbs. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.

**The API is still in beta so you may encounter bugs or things that don't make sense.** Please let us know about these by email or in Slack. Thanks!
