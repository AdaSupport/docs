# Chat UI
Every bot has a Web Chat feature which they can turn on in their settings. The chat UI can be given directly to your team or users for interacting with your bot by passing them the URL to it. The URL for your chat UI is https://bothandle.ada.support/chat/ where "bothandle" is the handle to your bot.
